# Feeding Naruto - Game

---

Naruto loves to eat ramen! In this game you have to help Naruto eat as much ramen as he can.

## Instructions

Use your mouse movement to pick up **ONLY RAMEN** and feed Naturo. You can see how many ramens you have eaten in the upper right corner of the screen.

If you hit another element, it's game over!
But you can restart the game by pressing **EAT AGAIN** button.

**Good game!** :heart:

## Project Challenge

This is an Ironhack's game challenge.
I used HTML(with canvas graphic), CSS and plain JavaScript with DOM manipulation and OOP.

The game was deployed online using GitHub Pages so that anybody can play it.
